# Guess-The-Word
Hey there! I've created this cool word guessing game called 'Guess The Word.' It's a fun challenge where players have to guess a secret word within a set number of tries. As a player, you'll input letters, and the game will give you feedback:

- If you guess a letter that's in the word and in the right position, it'll light up in green.
- If the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it'll show up in orange.
- And if it's not in the word at all, it'll be marked in gray.

You also have the option to use hints, but use them wisely! The game ends when you've either guessed the word correctly or run out of attempts. It's a challenging yet exciting game of word mastery!
